	•	[HTTP]同步相机3031成功: “Camera 3031 synchronization successful.”

Time: 09:13:55
	•	[HTTP]相机连接成功: “Camera connection successful.”

The subsequent entries follow a similar pattern, indicating repeated attempts to connect and synchronize with the camera at different times throughout the day.

Summary of the Process:
	1.	Bluetooth Scanning and Connection: The iOS device initiates a Bluetooth scan and establishes a connection with the camera.
	2.	Bluetooth Version Retrieval: After connecting, the device retrieves the Bluetooth version information from the camera.
	3.	Device Identification: The system logs the camera’s identification details, including model and unique identifier.
	4.	Wi-Fi Search and Connection:
	•	The system searches for a direct Wi-Fi connection to the camera.
	•	Initially, it connects to a network named “Zuhause5G,” but this connection fails (error=4).
	•	Subsequently, it successfully connects to the camera’s Wi-Fi network “RD7010PRO-cc641a22295e.”
	5.	Network Stabilization: After establishing the Wi-Fi connection, the system waits briefly to ensure network stability.
	6.	Information Synchronization: The device synchronizes various settings with the camera, including date, time, mode, and other parameters, culminating in a successful connection.

This sequence demonstrates the device’s process of establishing a stable connection with the camera, transitioning from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi, and ensuring all necessary settings are synchronized for optimal functionality.
